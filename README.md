# Problem-solving-in-multiple-languages

This repository contains solutions to various problem-solving challenges implemented in multiple programming languages: **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **PHP**. The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how problems can be solved using different approaches and syntax across these languages.

## Folders

- **`js/`**: Contains JavaScript solutions to problems.
- **`python/`**: Contains Python solutions to problems.
- **`php/`**: Contains PHP solutions to problems.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the solutions, choose the language folder you are interested in (JS, Python, or PHP), and you will find the relevant problem-solving code.

### Prerequisites

- **JavaScript**: You can run JS files using any modern browser's developer tools or Node.js.
- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed. You can run Python files using `python <filename>.py`.
- **PHP**: Make sure you have PHP installed. Run PHP scripts from the command line using `php <filename>.php`.
